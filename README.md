# Accident-Severity-Prediction

The project predicts the severity of a road accident by data mining files available on UK road safety from the UK Department of Transport.

The project is divided into two parts:

### Preprocessing Stage:

A business objective is set and a number of pre-processing steps (data transformation, data cleaning, normalization, subset selection, etc.) is done on the dataset before a statistical or a machine learning model is constructed:

(1) Introduction: business objective and its context (the practical problem that can be later solved with a regression or classification model)

(2) Descriptive statistics on the dataset

(3) Exploratory data analysis

(4) Data preprocessing (data cleaning, normalization, scaling, handling missing values, removal of outliers, etc.)

(5) Construction of predictive features (optional)

### Creation of Predictive Model:

The following steps are present:

(1) Introduction

(2) Baseline method

(3) Feature selection (optional)

(4) Hyperparameter tuning

(5) Model evaluation

(6) Conclusion: key findings, possible future improvements
